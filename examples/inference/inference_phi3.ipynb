      "Phillip, there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the same level of energy efficiency. I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You say that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I just did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost was about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we can discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. If your budget is $85-90 per sq. ft.  excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of the true custom home level but should be achievable with good management.\n",

      "I have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?  Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.

The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.\n",

Gave me a book of prayers and money....That's what I'm talkin' about!! (I'm going to he@@). Anyway, my boss calls me as we are finishing up and asks me if I knew anything about a meeting I was supposed to be working for NP's (nurse practitioners) at the Westin and I'm like \"Uh, No...never got the message\". Well, never got the message because she never sent it. Bottom line, I had to blow off all my plans(I was actually planning on calling on doctors today and getting ready for my monday program) and go work this meeting which isn't that big of deal. We just stand around at display tables and answer questions from the doctors/NP's. I was there for and hour and then went to lunch. I came back for an hour and have to do some things here. The good thing about my boss is she's very \"hand's off\". She stays out of your business unless you call her for something. She has a life outside of this job which is rare for managers. The bad thing is she can be \"flighty\" sometimes and forgets to send things on or lets them pile up and we get the messages a week late (which is probably what happened in this case)\n",

      "Tracy called me at work.  A water pipe broke under the street between her house and the old Hamilton house.  She said water was shooting everywhere and that they were to turn off the water for at least 5 hours.  Well, they worked fast because when I got home at 6:00, I had water.  So I made some turkey soup.  But Willow Lane will be torn up for a while as it just buckled the cement.  The hole was about 7 feet down according to Tracy.  Good thing this didn't happen on Thanksgiving!  I have a foundation man coming out next week to check the foundation.  Tracy seems to have a similar problem.  Maybe we can get a two for one deal.    John, I need your book list at Amazon.com this week.  No excuses!  Oh, tell Jeannie that I finished her soup this evening for dinner.  She's a good cook!  Have a good week guys.  Love, Mom\n",
